							<span>I am Jasper R. Turado, a third-year student, a thinker, a fighter, but most importantly, a cat-lover. I live in Valenzuela City, where I spent my days studying from preparatory to high school. Growing up in this vibrant city has shaped my perspective on life and instilled in me a strong sense of community. From exploring its bustling streets to immersing myself in its rich culture, Valenzuela City holds a special place in my heart. As a 19-year-old student, I am passionate about delving into the realms of knowledge, constantly seeking to expand my understanding of the world around me. Whether it's through academic pursuits or personal experiences, I thrive on the opportunity to learn and grow. That is why I made a decision to step out of my comfort zone and wander the streets of Manila, study in a well-renowned school known as the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. Currently, I am taking a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science, and I am expected to graduate in 2025.<br><br>

							<span>Math has always been my thing. Having participated in multiple contests ever since I was young, I’m pretty confident that I’ve built a really good foundation over this subject. Algebra and geometry are where I excel the most, finding joy in unraveling complex equations and geometric proofs. But my love for math extends beyond the confines of the classroom. As a programmer, I find myself applying mathematical principles in my daily life, whether it's optimizing code efficiency or problem-solving in algorithm development. Math isn't just a subject to me; it's a tool that empowers me to tackle challenges creatively and analytically. From designing algorithms to analyzing data trends, my proficiency in mathematics enriches every aspect of my life and fuels my passion for continuous learning and exploration.<br><br>

							I've been a consistent placer in MMC during elementary and high school, and an outstanding awardee in Mathematics. In fact, I’ve recently won in many mathematical contests hosted by the top schools in the Philippines including University of Santo Tomas and Ateneo de Manila University. I’ve also ventured in national and international contests hosted by UP Diliman and other international organizations but wasn’t fortunate enough to bag any titles. The most recent achievement in Math that I can proudly brag to anyone is becoming a part of Photomath Marketplace’s Team of Math Experts.</span>

							<span>As a computer science student, of course, coding is what I do. Coding really did not start out as a hobby; it's just one of the few things that I fortunately can do, aside from Math. I've immersed myself in various programming languages, each offering its own unique challenges and opportunities for creativity. From the foundational principles of C to the versatility of Python, and from the dynamic web development trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the structured database querying of SQL, I've explored a diverse array of languages and technologies. Whether it's building sleek user interfaces, crafting efficient algorithms, or designing robust databases, I thrive on the intricacies of software development and the endless possibilities it offers for innovation and problem-solving. My journey as a programmer is fueled by a relentless curiosity and a passion for mastering new skills, propelling me forward in my pursuit of excellence in the ever-evolving world of technology.
							<br><br>
							I am also looking forward to knowing more about data science and data mining. The realm of data analysis fascinates me, offering insights into patterns and trends that drive decision-making and innovation. I've been delving into research on AI, particularly generative AI, as it aligns closely with the focus of my thesis. Exploring the intricacies of artificial intelligence not only expands my understanding of cutting-edge technology but also opens doors to groundbreaking possibilities in fields such as natural language processing, image recognition, and beyond. With each discovery, I am propelled further into the depths of this ever-evolving field, eager to uncover new methodologies and applications that will shape the future of technology and society.</span>

							<span>Music holds a special place in my heart, serving as a soundtrack to my emotions and a source of solace during moments of boredom. To me, music is one of the most incredible inventions ever, with its ability to evoke feelings and transport us to different worlds. My taste in music spans across genres and cultures, reflecting my eclectic musical palate. From the catchy tunes of Western pop icons like Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, and Sam Smith, to the electrifying energy of bands like Imagine Dragons and American Authors, each song resonates with me in its own unique way. Delving into Indonesian pop, particularly Pamungkas's soulful melodies, adds a touch of international flavor to my playlist. However, my true passion lies in J-pop, where the enchanting sounds of RADWIMPS, Kenshi Yonezu, Vaundy, and others captivate my soul with their mesmerizing melodies and poignant lyrics. And not to forget, I also indulge in some mainstream OPM, enriching my musical journey with the vibrant sounds of local artists. With every note and every beat, music continues to inspire and uplift me, making each listening experience a cherished moment of joy and discovery.</span>

							<span>Gaming is more than just a hobby for me; it's a journey filled with excitement, camaraderie, and endless adventures. Among the myriad of games I've explored, Genshin Impact stands out as my absolute favorite, transporting me to a breathtaking world of wonder and magic. Whether embarking on quests, uncovering hidden treasures, or mastering elemental combat, Genshin captivates me with its immersive gameplay and captivating storyline. For casual fun with friends, Mobile Legends offers the perfect escape, where we team up to battle it out in thrilling matches, laughing and strategizing together along the way. In the realm of nostalgia, Ragnarok holds a special place in my heart, evoking memories of epic battles and unforgettable quests. Meanwhile, the addictive gameplay of Supercell's titles like Clash Royale and Clash of Clans keeps me hooked for hours on end, as I build, strategize, and clash my way to victory. And amidst the vast landscapes of creativity, Minecraft provides a canvas for endless exploration and boundless imagination. However, amidst the joy and excitement of gaming, there's one game I despise—the game called life, with its unpredictable challenges and unforgiving rules. But within the digital realms of gaming, I find solace, inspiration, and a sense of belonging, making each gaming session a cherished escape from the complexities of reality.</span>
